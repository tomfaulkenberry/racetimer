## racetimer

This is a simple python script to allow user to record race times of finishers as they cross the finish line.  To run, simply type `python racetimer.py` in a terminal.

Still to do:
- record full times rather than laps
- output file times do not get read correctly when importing into a spreadsheet.  Need to think about time format
- respond to button press (spacebar??)
- tweak the TKinter GUI...would like it to be a bit bigger
